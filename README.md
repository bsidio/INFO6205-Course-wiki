# INFO-6205 Program Structures and Algorithm

Welcome to the Program Structure and Algorithm course! In this course, we will explore the fundamental building blocks of computer programs and learn how to design and analyze efficient algorithms to solve a wide range of computational problems. We will cover topics such as data structures, control structures, functions, recursion, and complexity analysis. Throughout the course, we will use real-world examples and hands-on programming exercises to solidify our understanding of these concepts. By the end of the course, you will have a deep understanding of program structure and algorithm design, which will enable you to write efficient, well-structured programs to solve complex computational problems.
